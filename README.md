# NVH_Bosch_iNSCRIBE
The reduction of Noise, Vibration, and Harshness (NVH) in DC motor is one of the challenging task for car manufacturers. Methods to reduce NVH are found out and they do not prove to be too beneficial. In this paper, a cost effective and operational method has been analyzed. The use of sandwich metal composites using a viscoelastic core EC2216 and their characteristics has been investigated. It has been shown that the primary benefit of using a sandwich material is that the mass reduction of the entire system. The efficacy of damping of forced vibration by implementing sandwich material has been studied. The damping of vibrations and minimization of resonance is much effective by using sandwich material.
